# Security-Operation-Center
My first Splunk app for a smaller Information Security Team. I named it the Security Operations Center. Splunk does have the InfoSec App which does WAY more than this. However, this is pulling in basic information to help any junior security team get their feet wet before they go down the rabbit hole and build out data models for data correlation.
